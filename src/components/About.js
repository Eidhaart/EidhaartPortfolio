      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I&lsquo;m Martin, a versatile and dedicated web developer with a
        background in IT support, game-based therapy, and community
        organization. I&lsquo;m passionate about using technology and design to
        solve real-world problems and make meaningful impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&lsquo;ve worked with clients on diverse projects including animal
        rescue services, stunt show promotions, and personal branding for
        artists. When I&lsquo;m not building clean, performant websites with
        Next.js, I&lsquo;m running tabletop RPGs, painting miniatures, or
        exploring new tools to level up my dev game.
